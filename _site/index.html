  <h2 id="things-i-believe">Things I believe:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Earth’s resources are abundant</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We produce enough food for 10+ billion people — distribution and waste are the real problems</li>
        <li>Solar power in North Africa’s deserts could supply 40x the world’s electricity demand</li>
        <li>A 500W solar panel needs only ~1kg of refined silicon with energy payback in months, not years</li>
        <li>Scarcity is manufactured by inefficiency, politics, and lack of imagination</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The overpopulation narrative is destructive nihilism</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We’re facing population decline so severe that entire cultures could disappear</li>
        <li>Every major city on Earth could fit in Texas with suburban density</li>
        <li>More humans = more problem solvers = better future</li>
        <li>The carrying capacity of Earth with current tech is probably 100+ billion</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Every user interaction is a miracle</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>When someone uses your app, treat each tap as sacred and scarce</li>
        <li>Every calorie expended should benefit the network or another user</li>
        <li>Single-player features in social apps compound into network death</li>
        <li>Be extraordinarily intentional with every surface — don’t waste the gift of attention</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Speed is a feature, not a bug</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>You learn faster by colliding with reality more frequently</li>
        <li>Perfect is the enemy of shipped</li>
        <li>A week is 2% of the year — act accordingly</li>
        <li>Most “technical debt” is actually organizational debt</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Systems thinking beats component optimization</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Distributed systems are more resilient than they are complex</li>
        <li>The bottleneck is rarely where you think it is</li>
        <li>Most “impossible” problems are just badly framed questions</li>
        <li>Zero-knowledge proofs will reshape identity and privacy</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>AI must be human-centered, not human-replacing</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The goal isn’t AGI, it’s augmented human intelligence</li>
        <li>Ethics isn’t a constraint on AI development — it’s the foundation</li>
        <li>Medical AI should empower doctors, not replace them</li>
        <li>Privacy-preserving ML is possible and necessary</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Small teams build the future</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>5 excellent engineers &gt; 50 good ones</li>
        <li>Most tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed</li>
        <li>Consensus is where good ideas go to die</li>
        <li>Give individuals maximum agency and accountability</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The market for technological courage is inefficient</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Most “impossible” things haven’t been seriously attempted</li>
        <li>The best opportunities exist where others see constraints</li>
        <li>In many domains, 100 people shape the entire field</li>
        <li>Technical risk is overpriced, execution risk is underpriced</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Energy abundance changes everything</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Cheap energy makes previously impossible things trivial</li>
        <li>Solar + batteries already won — we’re just watching deployment</li>
        <li>Desalination, vertical farming, and carbon capture become obvious at &lt;$0.01/kWh</li>
        <li>The Kardashev Scale is a when, not an if</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>You can do more than you think</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Most limitations are social conventions, not laws of physics</li>
        <li>The distance between idea and implementation is shrinking exponentially</li>
        <li>One motivated person with modern tools can outperform entire departments from 10 years ago</li>
        <li>The permission you’re waiting for will never come — ship it</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
