## Things I Believe to be true

- **Abundance of Earth's Resources:**  
  The idea that we don't have enough resources on Earth for humans is simply not true.  
  - The planet produces enough food to feed billions — food waste and distribution are the real problems, not scarcity.
  - Material resources like metals and minerals are plentiful; advances in recycling and extraction make them more accessible.
  - Most scarcity narratives are linked to inefficiency, poor management, politics, and lack of innovation — not actual shortages.
  - Global energy consumption is a tiny fraction of the energy that reaches Earth from the sun every hour.

- **Solar Energy Can Power the World:**  
  Solar panels and batteries have already reached a level of advancement that makes it technically feasible to power the entire planet.
  - The Sahara Desert receives enough solar energy to supply all of humanity's electricity needs with a relatively small solar farm.
  - A field in Southern Italy could power all of Europe—calculations show a few thousand square kilometers of panels would suffice.
  - Battery storage and grid tech are rapidly advancing, making 24/7 clean energy realistic.
  - The main barriers are political, economic, and organizational—not scientific or technological.
