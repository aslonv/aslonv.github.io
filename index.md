# Bekali Aslonov
<p class="tagline">systems, engineering, and the belief that constraints are mostly imaginary</p>

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Some things about me:

* Grew up in Uzbekistan, educated across three continents
* On the Internet since 2008, building things since 2016
* Studying Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino + International Economics at Georgetown
* Published researcher in AI ethics and medical technology (47 citations and counting)
* Led team SAM to qualify for Africa & Arab Programming Championships
* Software/ML Engineer at eyeTech, bridging research and production
* Live in Turin, Italy — Europe's best-kept secret for deep tech
* Working on zero-knowledge identity systems and distributed inference
* Believe the world has enough of everything, just terrible distribution

## Things I believe:

* **Earth's resources are abundant**
  * We produce enough food for 10+ billion people — distribution and waste are the real problems
  * Solar power in North Africa's deserts could supply 40x the world's electricity demand
  * A 500W solar panel needs only ~1kg of refined silicon with energy payback in months, not years
  * Scarcity is manufactured by inefficiency, politics, and lack of imagination

* **The overpopulation narrative is destructive nihilism**
  * We're facing population decline so severe that entire cultures could disappear
  * Every major city on Earth could fit in Texas with suburban density
  * More humans = more problem solvers = better future
  * The carrying capacity of Earth with current tech is probably 100+ billion

* **Every user interaction is a miracle**
  * When someone uses your app, treat each tap as sacred and scarce
  * Every calorie expended should benefit the network or another user
  * Single-player features in social apps compound into network death
  * Be extraordinarily intentional with every surface — don't waste the gift of attention

* **Speed is a feature, not a bug**
  * You learn faster by colliding with reality more frequently
  * Perfect is the enemy of shipped
  * A week is 2% of the year — act accordingly
  * Most "technical debt" is actually organizational debt

* **Systems thinking beats component optimization**
  * Distributed systems are more resilient than they are complex
  * The bottleneck is rarely where you think it is
  * Most "impossible" problems are just badly framed questions
  * Zero-knowledge proofs will reshape identity and privacy

* **AI must be human-centered, not human-replacing**
  * The goal isn't AGI, it's augmented human intelligence
  * Ethics isn't a constraint on AI development — it's the foundation
  * Medical AI should empower doctors, not replace them
  * Privacy-preserving ML is possible and necessary

* **Small teams build the future**
  * 5 excellent engineers > 50 good ones
  * Most tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed
  * Consensus is where good ideas go to die
  * Give individuals maximum agency and accountability

* **The market for technological courage is inefficient**
  * Most "impossible" things haven't been seriously attempted
  * The best opportunities exist where others see constraints
  * In many domains, 100 people shape the entire field
  * Technical risk is overpriced, execution risk is underpriced

* **Energy abundance changes everything**
  * Cheap energy makes previously impossible things trivial
  * Solar + batteries already won — we're just watching deployment
  * Desalination, vertical farming, and carbon capture become obvious at <$0.01/kWh
  * The Kardashev Scale is a when, not an if

* **You can do more than you think**
  * Most limitations are social conventions, not laws of physics
  * The distance between idea and implementation is shrinking exponentially
  * One motivated person with modern tools can outperform entire departments from 10 years ago
  * The permission you're waiting for will never come — ship it
