Currently based in Turin, Italy, Aslonov works as a Software/ML Engineer at eyeTech while maintaining active research affiliations with prestigious institutions across multiple continents. His work demonstrates a rare combination of theoretical depth and practical application, from zero-knowledge cryptographic systems to ethical AI frameworks for medical training.

## Academic Excellence Spans Two Continents

Aslonov's educational journey reflects his global perspective and interdisciplinary approach. He is currently completing his studies at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Qatar, majoring in International Economics with an expected graduation in 2025. Simultaneously, he holds a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Politecnico di Torino's Department of Control and Computer Engineering in Italy, one of Europe's most prestigious technical universities.

This unique combination of economics and engineering education provides him with both the technical depth to innovate and the economic framework to understand technology's broader societal implications. His academic work spans institutional boundaries, with research collaborations extending from Georgetown University Qatar to Carnegie Mellon University Qatar and Mohammed V University in Morocco.

Before his current studies, Aslonov attended the Academic Lyceum of Computer Technologies under Tashkent State Technical University, establishing his early foundation in computational systems.

## Breakthrough Research in Medical AI Ethics

Aslonov's academic publications demonstrate remarkable productivity and impact for an emerging researcher. His ResearchGate profile shows 47 citations and 264 reads, indicating significant engagement with his work in the research community.

His most significant contribution, **"Humanizing AI in medical training: ethical framework for responsible design,"** published in *Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence* in May 2023, addresses one of the most pressing challenges in modern healthcare technology. The paper proposes a comprehensive five-pillar ethical framework encompassing transparency, fairness, safety, accountability, and collaboration. This work positions him as a thought leader in responsible AI development, particularly in high-stakes medical environments.

His second major publication, **"Eye tracking technology in medical practice: a perspective on its diverse applications,"** published in *Frontiers in Medical Technology* in November 2023, demonstrates his technical depth in computer vision applications. The comprehensive review explores eye tracking across multiple medical disciplines including neurology, cardiology, and surgery, showcasing his ability to synthesize complex technical concepts across interdisciplinary boundaries.

Both publications are open access, maximizing their potential impact and demonstrating his commitment to knowledge sharing in critical areas of medical technology.

## Technical Innovation Through High-Performance Systems

Aslonov's GitHub portfolio reveals 18 repositories showcasing sophisticated technical expertise across multiple domains. His projects demonstrate a systems thinking approach combined with deep technical implementation skills.

His **Number-Theoretic Transform implementation with AVX2 acceleration** showcases expertise in high-performance computing, optimizing mathematical operations at the hardware level. Written in Rust and supporting 61-bit primes with AVX2 optimization for 31-bit primes, this project demonstrates his belief in computational efficiency and performance optimization.

The **distributed inference system project** reveals his approach to scalable AI architecture. Built in Python with microservices design, it supports multiple neural network models including MobileNet, ResNet18, and EfficientNet. This fault-tolerant system reflects his preference for resilient, distributed architectures over monolithic approaches.

His **neurobiomorphic AI system** combines neuroplasticity, reinforcement learning, and language reasoning capabilities, indicating his interest in bio-inspired computing models that could lead to more general intelligence systems.

Most notably, his **ZKPersonhood project** demonstrates cutting-edge work in zero-knowledge proof systems for identity verification, positioning him at the forefront of privacy-preserving technologies and decentralized identity solutions.

## Competition Excellence and Collaborative Leadership

In November 2021, Aslonov demonstrated his competitive programming skills by leading team "SAM" to a top 5 finish in the Qatar Collegiate Programming Competition, competing against over 50 students from 18 teams. The achievement qualified his team for the 24th Africa and Arab Collegiate Programming Championship in Egypt.

His approach to the competition reveals his philosophical stance: 

> "My programming background is mostly about building and designing business-related products. So it was a great experience to implement more mathematical and systemic methods."

This quote illuminates his practical orientation toward technology development and his continuous learning mindset.

## Technical Philosophy and Systems Approach

Aslonov's work reveals a coherent technical philosophy centered on several key principles. His emphasis on distributed systems and fault tolerance suggests belief in resilient architectures that can handle real-world complexity. His zero-knowledge proof work indicates strong conviction about privacy-preserving technologies and user sovereignty over personal data.

His projects span from low-level hardware optimization to high-level AI systems, indicating belief in full-stack technical understanding. His choice of programming languages—primarily Rust and Python—reflects pragmatic tool selection prioritizing both performance and productivity.

The intersection of his medical AI research with his systems engineering projects suggests he views technology as most valuable when it addresses real human needs, particularly in healthcare where reliability and ethics are paramount.

## Global Research Network and Collaborative Impact

Aslonov's research demonstrates extensive international collaboration. His publications include co-authors from institutions across Qatar, Italy, Morocco, and the UAE, reflecting his ability to work effectively across cultural and institutional boundaries.

His current role as Software/ML Engineer at eyeTech while maintaining research activities suggests his commitment to bridging the research-to-practice gap. This dual engagement with industry and academia positions him to understand both the theoretical possibilities and practical constraints of advanced technology implementation.

## Engineering the Future Responsibly

Bekali Aslonov represents the emerging generation of engineer-researchers who combine technical excellence with ethical responsibility and global perspective. His work addresses some of the most challenging questions in modern technology: How do we build AI systems that are both powerful and ethical? How do we create distributed systems that are both performant and resilient? How do we preserve privacy while enabling innovation?

His trajectory suggests someone positioned to make significant contributions at the intersection of advanced computing, healthcare technology, and ethical AI development. With growing academic citations, sophisticated technical projects, and a demonstrated commitment to responsible innovation, Aslonov is establishing himself as a thoughtful leader in the next generation of technology development.
